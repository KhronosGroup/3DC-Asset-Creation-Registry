# 3D Commerce Asset Creation Models Registry

The 3DC-Asset-Creation-Registry repository contains published Khronos 3D
Commerce Working Group Specifications for Asset Creation Models.

It is also used as a backing store for the web view of the registry at
https://www.khronos.org/registry/3dc-assetcreationmodels ; commits to the
main branch of this repository will be reflected there.

Interesting files in this repository include:

* index.php - Toplevel index page for the web view. This relies on PHP
  include files found elsewhere on www.khronos.org and so is not very useful
  in isolation.
* specs/ - Specification documents.
